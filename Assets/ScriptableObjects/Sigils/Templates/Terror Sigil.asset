  _description: "Using your Defensive ability (successfully) generates a Heavy Attack
    charge.\r\n\r\nDefenseless villages and farming hamlets were the favourite prey
    of Brazen, the nocturnal black dragon. Though he was among the smallest of dragons,
    none other struck fear into the hearts of humans as he did."
