# Sky-Seekers (WIP)
A Unity Game made for practice. This game was an exercise in creating RPG-esque systems (inventory and abilities) using Unity best practices.

You control a group of wanderers and fight other wanderers.

# Instructions
Each character has four slots of sigils it can have equipped. These sigils give combat bonuses.

Each character is also unique in their combat abilities.

In combat, each character has a set of actions: light attack, heavy attack, special attack, support ability, and defensive ability.

Your characters will also fight in a formation where one is the Frontline and the other is the Support. At any time you may swap their positions.

Performing a support ability will cause your Support character (rather than your Frontline) to use their support ability.
